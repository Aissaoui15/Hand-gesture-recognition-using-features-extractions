# Hand-gesture-recognition-using-features-extractions

An EMG-based system for recognizing hand gestures
Features are the usable units of data from raw signals. Feature extraction is a fundamental 
component to transform the raw data into usable input for the classification algorithm. 
There are three kinds of features in EMG signals : time domain features, frequency domain 
features, and time-frequency domain.
